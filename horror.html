My bua was possessed by some ghosts (yes plural, there were 6 or 7 in total) around 15 years ago. She would eat LOTS of food and even tried choking her daughter who was around 7 at that time. Everyone would lock the kitchen because, well, she ate a lot. She once told everyone that the ghosts had left her body and she felt really hungry suddenly so we gave her food and after eating she said in a creepy voice &quot;mai gya nhi hun&quot; and started chuckling. Gives me chills. She would go around the house but would never enter the &#x27;pooja room&#x27; and everytime pandits were called she would tell them to go otherwise she&#x27;d have to kill their families. The funny part is that the ghosts would actually tell their story (their name, where they lived, how they died etc) through her, a man was killed by his brother bc of property issues, some killed themselves, there was also a boy who was searching for his dead gf&#x27;s ghost. After long lines of pandits who would come and leave we were finally able to free her. We laugh and joke now about how much food was given to the ghosts, but tbh the village she lives in is kinda scary. Many people have been killed there and apparently some can perform black magic. I never told my friends about this bc it sounds like something straight out of a comedy horror movie but ik its true. </p></div><br/><div class="Stocks_stockContainer__dd_Ae"><p>@anonymous</p><p>After my grandfather&#x27;s demise, my grandmother had started hearing his voices and the sound of the metal stick that he used to use to call her incase she was far as he was paralysed at his feet and couldn&#x27;t walk. Now the case here was that she had started living in my mama&#x27;s house after grandpa&#x27;s demise which was like 3-4 meters away from their old house where my grandpa and grandma use to stay earlier.so the whole time grandpa &amp; grandma use to stay in the old mud house due to certain disputes in the family.so now she had started hearing some calling her in the midnight. This happened so much that one day she left that mama&#x27;s house in midnight and started walking towards their old house and it is more scary because they live in a village that follows an order to not get out of thier house after 6 as there is danger of tigers due to a national reserve around the village. That day fortunately nothing happened and my mama saw her and got her in. Everyone started shouting at grandma for her such behaviour. She repeatedly explained everyone that she could also hear the door knocks and the stick everyday. The other day when my mama gave her some medicinnes so that she could sleep nicely as this everyday drama was affecting her health. He stayed up a bit late to just chcek up on her so that she doesn&#x27;t get up. But tht day he heard some voices of his father calling him and then the stick voice and afte some time even the door knocks from the old house. He was scared but when he looked out of the window ,as he narrated to us, the loose wooden door was moving in a way that actually someone is pushing it from inside and banging it. He could not ignore this incident as this happened more than 3-4 times. Then they did some pooja, after which things were sorted and it took a week to grandma to get her condition well.</p></div><br/><div class="Stocks_stockContainer__dd_Ae"><p>@anonymous</p><p>I used live in Airoli, Navi Mumbai i was around 8/9 years old when this incident happened with me. Me and two elder brothers would play cricket every evening with other kids from society. We had one simple rule that if someone hits a six outside the gate or somewhere in building there will be a person chosen everday to get it. It was my turn that evening and i regret that it was. One of the players hit a six on the 7th floor which was my worst fear, whenever i heard about that particular floor I would&#x27;ve chills the reason was because it was haunted by 3 diff spirits a mother and her two twins my grandfather told me about it as he and the early members of the society witnessed the gruesome incident. When the society was formed there were only 6/7 families living in it, in 701 lived Mr. And Mrs.Rai with their twins Kshitij and Kshitija who were around my age, they seemed to be the perfect couple but it is not always as it seems, Mr. Rai was having an affair and he was going to divorce Mrs. Rai she got a hint of it and decided to confront her husband, when she did in a drunken state Mr. Rai attacked her strangled her to death and same with the children, he stripped his dead wife naked and hanged her and the kids pn the terrace and left, my grandfather and other society members called the police and saw the horrific state that the lady was in. Husband&#x27;s body was found few weeks later in a lake covered by leeches. After knowing all this l was always scared of going near that flat even the floor, but as it was my turn i didnt have a choice but go and get the ball as i reached the 7th floor in Mid-May there was a different level of cold only on that particular floor I spotted the ball i quickly tried to get it and run but i felt like my legs were frozen and i couldn&#x27;t move a bit, I felt like someone was touching me someone was trying to say something i tried to listen carefully the voice came from two distinctive sides one from the terrace and the other from flat number 701 i was crying, shivering and tried to call out my mom over and over but it felt like I was in a chamber where my voice wasn&#x27;t just going to be heard. The voice kept on saying my name i remember i saw a lady standing near the stairs going up to the terrace and kids near the flats door after few minutes i was unconscious. My parents found me on the 7th floor burning with fever and bruises on my legs and back. It was a complete week my fever was the same i couldn&#x27;t say anything to my parents as I was shocked my grandfather was out of town due to some work once he was back i told him everything as I thought he would believe me and he did, he arranged some pooja and my fever started to get better after it. This incident has left a mark on my heart and mind which can never be erased&quot;</p></div><br/><p class="Stocks_footerNote__LpJ5B">This page shows you <b>Real Life Paranormal Experiences</b> by the people who themselves or someone they know have experienced it.
